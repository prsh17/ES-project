                Air pollution<br><br>
            </h1>
            <div class="container">
                <p>Air pollution is the contamination of air due to the presence of substances in the atmosphere that
                    are harmful to the health of humans and other living beings, or cause damage to the climate or to
                    materials.There are many different types of air pollutants, such as gases (including ammonia, carbon
                    monoxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrous oxides, methane, carbon dioxide and chlorofluorocarbons),
                    particulates (both organic and inorganic), and biological molecules.
                    <br><br>
                    Air pollution can cause diseases, allergies, and even death to humans; it can also cause harm to
                    other living organisms such as animals and food crops, and may damage the natural environment (for
                    example, climate change, ozone depletion or habitat degradation) or built environment (for example,
                    acid rain).Air pollution can be caused by both human activities and natural phenomena.
                    <br><br>
                    Air pollution is a significant risk factor for a number of pollution-related diseases, including
                    respiratory infections, heart disease, COPD, stroke and lung cancer. Growing evidence suggests that
                    air pollution exposure may be associated with reduced IQ scores, impaired cognition,increased risk
                    for psychiatric disorders such as depression and detrimental perinatal health.
                    <br><br>
                    The human health effects of poor air quality are far reaching, but principally affect the body's
                    respiratory system and the cardiovascular system. Individual reactions to air pollutants depend on
                    the type of pollutant a person is exposed to, the degree of exposure, and the individual's health
                    status and genetics.
                    <br><br>
                    Outdoor air pollution attributable to fossil fuel use alone causes ~3.61 million deaths annually,
                    making it one of the top contributors to human death,with anthropogenic ozone and PM2.5 causing ~2.1
                    million. Overall, air pollution causes the deaths of around 7 million people worldwide each year, or
                    a global mean loss of life expectancy (LLE) of 2.9 years,[12] and is the world's largest single
                    environmental health risk, which has not shown significant progress since at least 2015.
                    <br><br>
                    Indoor air pollution and poor urban air quality are listed as two of the world's worst toxic
                    pollution problems in the 2008 Blacksmith Institute World's Worst Polluted Places report.The scope
                    of the air pollution crisis is large: 90% of the world's population breathes dirty air to some
                    degree. Although the health consequences are extensive, the way the problem is handled is considered
                    largely haphazard or neglected.
                    <br><br>
                    Productivity losses and degraded quality of life caused by air pollution are estimated to cost the
                    world economy $5 trillion per year but, along with health and mortality impacts, are an externality
                    to the contemporary economic system and most human activity, albeit sometimes being moderately
                    regulated and monitored.
                    <br><br>
                    Various pollution control technologies and strategies are available to reduce air pollution. Several
                    international and national legislation and regulation have been developed to limit the negative
                    effects of air pollution.
                    <br><br>
                    Local rules, when properly executed, have resulted in significant advances in public health.Some of
                    these efforts have been successful at the international level, such as the Montreal Protocol,which
                    reduced the release of harmful ozone depleting chemicals, and the 1985 Helsinki Protocol, which
                    reduced sulphur emissions, while others, such as international action on climate change, have been
                    less successful.
